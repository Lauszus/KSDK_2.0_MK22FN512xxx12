# KSDK_2.0_MK22FN512xxx12

This repository contains the [NXP Kinetis SDK](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/development-platforms-with-mbed/software-development-kit-for-kinetis-mcus:KINETIS-SDK) v2.0 built for [MK22FN512xxx12](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/arm-processors/kinetis-cortex-m-mcus/k-series-performance-m4/k2x-usb/kinetis-k22-120-mhz-cost-effective-full-speed-usb-microcontrollers-mcus-based-on-arm-cortex-m4-core:K22_120) processors, all toolchains, Linux.

The SDK has been generated by the [Kinetis Export tool](https://kex.nxp.com/), and was cloned here solely for the purposes of easily including it from other repositories as a Git submodule.

The KSDK uses [open source licenses](https://community.freescale.com/message/613019#613019).

## Modifications

`startup_MK22F51212.S` [has been modified](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/KSDK_2.0_MK22FN512xxx12/commit/e522962619d01c6fe01f43af92573389968c7dcd?diff=split#diff-b8d7fda6da5d964a20a749774afb28f3) in order to relocate the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard firmware](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/firmware) that links to the KSDK. This way, the UHK firmware works with [KBOOT](http://www.nxp.com/applications/solutions-for-the-iot-and-adas/smart-connected-solutions-for-the-iot/smart-cities-in-the-age-of-iot/smart-energy/off-grid-solar-power-inverters/kinetis-bootloader:KBOOT).
